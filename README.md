## Subject: Proof of GitLab Push Error â€“ Unable to Submit Repository Link

Dear Prof Tursa,

I attempted to push my repository to GitLab but encountered an error due to the absence of a default branch. The error message states:

"A default branch (e.g., main) does not yet exist for courses/2025-winter/csci-5408/b00983747/quiz-4-csci5308. Ask a project Owner or Maintainer to create a default branch."

As a result, my push was rejected, and I was unable to submit the repository link. Below is a snippet of the error log for reference:

To ensure timely submission, I have created a new repository on GitHub and uploaded my project there.
